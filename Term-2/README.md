**Title**: Applications of the EM algorithm and Gaussian Processes

**Coordinator**: Associate prof. Liviu Ciortuz

**Type**: theory and practice

**Description**:

Developed EM algorithms for:
- **image segmentation** via EM/GMM, EM/GammaMM, EM/GammaMM, EM/RayleighMM, EM/NakagamiMM
- **missing data** (Bernoulli)
- **image deblurring** via Richardson-Lucy algorithm
- an application on **gene expression** via EM/GPMM (**EM for Gaussian Process Mixture Model**): The problem we are dealing with here concerns the analysis of gene expression (from bioinformatics) using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we will use the EM algorithm for Gaussian Process Mixture Models (GPMM) to solve this problem. By doing so, we will be able to perform two tasks simultaneously: **regression (via Gaussian Process Regression - GPR) and clustering**. The learning algorithm also involves the gradient ascent method and some empirical results are presented.
