**Description**:

Our task is forecasting natural gas consumption. It is very important for natural gas distribution companies to forecast their customers’ natural gas demand accurately. This is due to the fact that such a company has to specify how much quantity of gas their clients need in the next month, quarter and year. If the values provided are too high or too low, a high cost has to be paid. In this study, the results of forecasting monthly natural gas consumption are presented. The developed methodology uses data describing actual natural gas consumption from Romania and state-of-the-art techniques: linear regression, artificial neural networks [MLP], time series [ARIMA, ARIMAX]. The data was augmented with weather [temperature] factors in order to obtain better results. Customers were split into categories and for each category and for each month a model should be created.
